# Adventurer Journey - Back End
Please complete the story below and create a program to solve the problem. Commit any work back to the remote no later than 48 hours before the next interview.

*Please use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like to complete the story.*

## Story Instructions
You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

Adventurer Path & Instructions - [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md)

Given the Path Instructions above, programmatically parse the instructions and determine what is the Euclidean (straight line) distance from your starting point to the destination in steps?

**Tech Notes:**
- Use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like.
- Provide any needed instructions to run program.
- Do not round to the nearest step.
- After program executes the answer should be returned.

**To Run the Program:**
- Run main.py
- Program automatically tests instructions "15F6B6B5L16R8B16F20L6F13F11R" then allows the user to enter new instructions if desired
- To run test cases run distance_calculator_tests.py
- Program uses Python 3.12

**NOTE:**
The program has two methods to calculate euclidean distance:

1. One method assumes that the adventurer is always facing North. For example "5R5R" translates to 5 steps East, 5 steps East.
2. The other method assumes that the adventurer changes the direction they are facing with each instruction. For example "5R5R" translates to 5 steps East, 5 Steps South. This is because after the adventurer follows the first instruction "5R" they are now facing East and the next instruction "5R" will direct them 5 steps South.
